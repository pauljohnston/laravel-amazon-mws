Simple Amazon Marketplace Web Service API Package for Laravel

This package is under development. Currently we have only implemented the endpoints we are using.
Feel free to add the endpoints you need ([contribute](#contributing)).
A List of all available endpoints you can see under the endpoint [road map](#road-map).

ðŸš¨ Amazon Introduced a new [Selling Partner API](https://developer.amazonservices.com/)
A modernized suite of REST APIs utilizing standards. [Github Docs](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs)
The laravel-amazon-mws package provides only methods for the Amazon MWS service.
We will add a laravel package for the SP-Api next year (2021).

## Installation
This package requires PHP 7.3 and Laravel 8.0 or higher.
For older laravel versions install the latest 0.1.x version.

Require the package using composer:

```bash
composer require looxis/laravel-amazon-mws
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Add your Environment Variables for MWS to your .env File. The variable names are listed in the amazon-mws.php [config file](#configuration).

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

To successfully authenticate with the Amazon Marketplace Web Service you need to add the Environment variables to your `.env` File. The variable names are listed in the amazon-mws.php [config file](#configuration).
Also you can set a default marketplace.

You can optionally publish the configuration with:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Looxis\LaravelAmazonMWS\AmazonMWSServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This will create an `amazon-mws.php` in your config directory.

Config file content with the env variables:

```php
<?php

return [
    'access_key_id' => env('MWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret_key' => env('MWS_SECRET_KEY'),
    'seller_id' => env('MWS_SELLER_ID'),
    'mws_auth_token' => env('MWS_AUTH_TOKEN'),
    'default_market_place' => env('MWS_DEFAULT_MARKET_PLACE', 'DE'),
];
```

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

<a name="authentication"></a>
### Authentication
Amazon MWS authenticates you via the [Canonicalized Query String](https://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/dev_guide/DG_QueryString.html). The Laravel Amazon MWS Package handles this for you and adds the string for each request. You just have to add your seller specific credentials to your .env file ([configuration](#configuration)).

<a name="marketplaces"></a>
### Marketplaces
If you need to change the marketplaces just set the country/countries in your code via the MWS Facade.
For simplicity the package chooses the right endpoint and market place id via the given country.
You do not have to set them by yourself.
([Amazon MWS endpoints and Market Place IDS Overview](https://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/dev_guide/DG_Endpoints.html)) If something is missing do not hesitate to create an issue.

```php
AmazonMWS::setMarketplaces('FR');

AmazonMWS::setMarketplaces('DE', 'FR');  //to append multiple marketplaces to your request query strings.
```

<a name="orders"></a>
### Orders

]);
```
##### Throttling
